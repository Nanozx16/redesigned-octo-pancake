phishing-detect
List of malicious domains targeting Web3 users.

For checking why a given domain was blocked, there is a third-party search tool maintained by ChainPatrol.

Blocking Policy
We are constantly evolving the ideal policy that guides this list, but a few clearly defined rules have emerged. We will be quick and decisive to block websites that:

Impersonate other known and established sites.
Use their interfaces to collect user signing keys (especially cryptocurrency keys) and send them back to home servers.
There are other grounds for blocking, and we will ultimately do our best to keep our users safe.

Basic usage
UPDATE: The phishing detector has been moved.
